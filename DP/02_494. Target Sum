494. Target Sum

Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false

 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	-104 <= Node.val <= 104
	root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
	-105 <= k <= 105

Approach:
DP
As we have to choose between 2 operation + and -
Base case becomes:
  idx==length of array and target = total so return 1
  idx==length return 0

Choice Add = idx+1 , total+nums[idx];
Choice Sub = idx+1 , total-nums[idx];
Return sum  = Add + Sub

Run 2 D Dp as we have - so sum can go from - to + and as we don't have negative index so we use 2*totalSum+1 to store all elements.
