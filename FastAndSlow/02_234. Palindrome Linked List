234. Palindrome Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome or false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,2,1]
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: false

 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 105].
	0 <= Node.val <= 9

 
Follow up: Could you do it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

Approach:
1. Determine middle of the list List.
2. Find reverse of the second half of the list.
3. Iterate on second half and try to compare the element from first half, return false if any of them are different.
Return true otherwise.
