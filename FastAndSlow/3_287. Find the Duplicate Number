287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
Output: 3

 
Constraints:

	1 <= n <= 105
	nums.length == n + 1
	1 <= nums[i] <= n
	All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.

 
Follow up:

	How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
	Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

Approach:
1. Use fast and slow pointer to determine value and exit loop once you slow==fast.(this run fast = nums[nums[fast]])
2. Start with iterating on both slow and fast pointer once they match. return answer. fast = nums[fast]
