19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

	n == height.length
	2 <= n <= 105
	0 <= height[i] <= 104

Approach 1:
Try to count number of node, now return which node to delete total - n;
Iterate of the index and remove the node by setting node.next = node.next.next;

Apporach 2:
1. Add Dummy pointer of the start of both the lists.
2. Start iterating fast pointer till i = n.
3. Now untill we reach end of the list with fast pointer iterate both fast and slow pointers.
4. Update slow with next element and removing slow.next node.
