905. Sort Array By Parity

Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

 
Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 5000
	0 <= nums[i] <= 5000

Approach 1:
Try to add element to Double ended queue even elemnet will be added to first and odd element will be added to last
Now create the element and put them into array as required.
Time complexity: O(n)
Space Complexisty: O(n)

Approach 2:
Define 2 pointer left and right
check if module 2 for left is greater than module 2 for right element that mean left element is odd and right is even,
Swap the numbers
if left is even move left pointer to next
if right is odd move right pointer by -1;

Time Complexity: O(n);
Space Comlexity: O(1);
