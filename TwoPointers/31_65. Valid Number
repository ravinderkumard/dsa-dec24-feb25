65. Valid Number

Given a string s, return whether s is a valid number.

For example, all the following are valid numbers: "2", "0089", "-0.1", "+3.14", "4.", "-.9", "2e10", "-90E3", "3e+7", "+6e-1", "53.5e93", "-123.456e789", while the following are not valid numbers: "abc", "1a", "1e", "e3", "99e2.5", "--6", "-+3", "95a54e53".

Formally, a valid number is defined using one of the following definitions:

	An integer number followed by an optional exponent.
	A decimal number followed by an optional exponent.

An integer number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by digits.

A decimal number is defined with an optional sign '-' or '+' followed by one of the following definitions:

	Digits followed by a dot '.'.
	Digits followed by a dot '.' followed by digits.
	A dot '.' followed by digits.

An exponent is defined with an exponent notation 'e' or 'E' followed by an integer number.

The digits are defined as one or more digits.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "0"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "e"

Output: false

Example 3:

Input: s = "."

Output: false

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 20
	s consists of only English letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits (0-9), plus '+', minus '-', or dot '.'.


Rules

Digits

First of all, there must always be at least one digit in the input for it to form a valid number. Let's use a variable seenDigit to indicate whether we have seen a digit yet.
Signs

If a sign is present, it must be the first character in a decimal number or integer. In a valid number, there are two possible locations for these signs - at the front of the number, or right after an exponent ("e" or "E") e.g., -63e+7. Therefore, if we see a sign, and it is not the first character of the input, and does not come immediately after an exponent ("e" or "E"), then we know the number is not valid.
Exponents ("e" or "E")

There cannot be more than one exponent in a valid number, so we will use a variable seenExponent to indicate whether we have already seen an exponent.
An exponent must appear after a decimal number or an integer. This means if we see an exponent, we must have already seen a digit.
Dots

There cannot be more than one dot in a valid number, since only integers are allowed after an exponent, so there cannot be more than one decimal number. We will use a variable seenDot to indicate whether we have seen a dot.
If we see a dot appear after an exponent, the number is not valid, because integers cannot have dots.
Anything else

Seeing anything else instantly invalidates the input.
