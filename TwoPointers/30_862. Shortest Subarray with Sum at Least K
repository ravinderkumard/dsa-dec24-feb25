862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 
Example 1:

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

 
Constraints:

	1 <= heights.length <= 105
	0 <= heights[i] <= 104


Approach:
This is similar to sliding window problem, but with additional requirement of -ve integer.
now if we have negative integer it is possible that later sum qualifies for the shortest array. So to support that
we have to consider prefixSum.
1. Define prefixSum array
2. If difference between current prefixSum and prefix sum of first elment of queue is greater than target.
Updpate min length
3. Define a double ended queue that will store element start position and as we found prefix sum smaller than current 
index remove the elemnt from end of queue.
4. Keep adding elemnet to deque as we move forward
