653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

Given the root of a binary search tree and an integer k, return true if there exist two elements in the BST such that their sum is equal to k, or false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 9
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], k = 28
Output: false

 
Constraints:

	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	-104 <= Node.val <= 104
	root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
	-105 <= k <= 105

Approach 1:
Define IN order traversal of BST.
use two pointer to find the matchings sum 

Approach 2:
Define DFS to reach to be last element of the BST as we reach null return false.
Return Search function with value k-curr.val, and iterat over searh condition
