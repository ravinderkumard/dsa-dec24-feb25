125. Valid Palindrome

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
	s consists only of printable ASCII characters.


Approach:
1. Use left and right pointers, and check if character is not alpha or digit increase left poitner and similarly 
decrease right pointer. 
2. if charaters are matching move left and right pointers respectively
3. return false if characters are not matching
