16. 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).

 
Constraints:

	3 <= nums.length <= 500
	-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
	-104 <= target <= 104

Approach:
1. Sort Array.
2. Use 2 pointer approach to find the triplet.
3. check if absolute minValue is greater than absolute value of target - sum of triplet.
4. update min value.
5. if sum is less than target move left pointer otherwise move right pointer.
6. Return target - minValue
