844. Backspace String Compare

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s[i] is a printable ascii character.

Approach 1:
1. Push each non # character to stack and start poping element as soon you reach #.
2. Compare 2 string 
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n);

Approach 2:
Consider 2 pointer each of string s and t.
iterate until either of them is greater than or equal to 0.
check for first pointer if greater than 0, determine if current character is '#', if yes increase skip counter by 1, if its a character and skip is greater than 0 
skip that element by decreasing counter by 1, same for t sstring.
check if character at current position for respective string are same if not return false.
check if we have valid index for any of the string return false if not.
decrement counter for both.
