844. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".

Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
	s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.

 
Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

Approach 1:
1. Push each non # character to stack and start poping element as soon you reach #.
2. Compare 2 string 
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n);

Approach 2:
Consider 2 pointer each of string s and t.
iterate until either of them is greater than or equal to 0.
check for first pointer if greater than 0, determine if current character is '#', 
if yes increase skip counter by 1, if its a character and skip is greater than 0 
skip that element by decreasing counter by 1, same for t sstring.
check if character at current position for respective string are same if not return false.
check if we have valid index for any of the string return false if not.
decrement counter for both.
