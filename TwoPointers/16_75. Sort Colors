75. Sort Colors

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 
Example 1:

Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

 
Constraints:

	n == height.length
	2 <= n <= 105
	0 <= height[i] <= 104

Approach 1:
Using 2 pointer, initialize left at 0, right at last index of array.
Start iterating from left to right using curr pointer.
as soon we found curr = 0 , swap with left ptr and move both left, curr ptr.
curr = 2 swap with right pointer and shift left poitner only.
other wise move curr pointer.
