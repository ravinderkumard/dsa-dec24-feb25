881. Boats to Save People

You are given an array people where people[i] is the weight of the ith person, and an infinite number of boats where each boat can carry a maximum weight of limit. Each boat carries at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weight of those people is at most limit.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every given person.

 
Example 1:

Input: people = [1,2], limit = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 boat (1, 2)

Example 2:

Input: people = [3,2,2,1], limit = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 boats (1, 2), (2) and (3)

Example 3:

Input: people = [3,5,3,4], limit = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: 4 boats (3), (3), (4), (5)

 
Constraints:

	1 <= people.length <= 5 * 104
	1 <= people[i] <= limit <= 3 * 104


Approach:
1. Sort element of array.
2. Define 2 pointer left and right.
3. if weight of left and right is less than limit they can accomodate in same boat so shift both pointers as elements
  are considered.
4. If they are not falling in same limit decrease only right pointer.
Time complexity: O(nlogn)
Space complexity : O(logN)


Approach 2:
1. Use count of people and create and array for those.
2. shift elemnet until non zero element are their.
3. if left + right is within limit update both values.
4.
