389. Find the Difference

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals k and remove them from the array.

Return the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array.

 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []
There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]
There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

 
Constraints:

	1 <= nums.length <= 105
	1 <= nums[i] <= 109
	1 <= k <= 109


Approach 1:
Convert String to arr and sort both.
Start Iterating over 2 arrays using 2 pointers.
if element are not same return as result
other wise increase both pointers.
if we reach end of string s, return element from string t as that is the only element left.

Approach 2:
While parsing 1st array, count number of character available in string.
While parsing 2nd array, start decrement the elmenet if it is not 0, otherwise that is the out.

Approach 3:
Use Bit wise.
Start bitwise with first array for each character.
use same result to bitwise with second array for each character.
return result.
