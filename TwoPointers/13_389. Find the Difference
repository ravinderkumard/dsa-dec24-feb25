389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings s and t.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to t.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:

Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

 
Constraints:

	0 <= s.length <= 1000
	t.length == s.length + 1
	s and t consist of lowercase English letters.





Approach 1:
Convert String to arr and sort both.
Start Iterating over 2 arrays using 2 pointers.
if element are not same return as result
other wise increase both pointers.
if we reach end of string s, return element from string t as that is the only element left.

Approach 2:
While parsing 1st array, count number of character available in string.
While parsing 2nd array, start decrement the elmenet if it is not 0, otherwise that is the out.

Approach 3:
Use Bit wise.
Start bitwise with first array for each character.
use same result to bitwise with second array for each character.
return result.
