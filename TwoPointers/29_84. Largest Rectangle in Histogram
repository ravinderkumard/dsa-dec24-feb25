84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers heights representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

 
Example 1:

Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

Example 2:

Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

 
Constraints:

	1 <= heights.length <= 105
	0 <= heights[i] <= 104


Approach:
1. Define a stack and start pushing element smaller than current to stack.
2. Check if current element is less than element on top of stack, 
    Remove that and calculate max area using height and width.
3. Once you reach end of elements, check if stack is empty or not.
4. If stack is not empty, try to process elment with full length of array considering with width and determin maxArea.
Time Complexity : O(n);
Space Complexity: O(n)


Approach:
1. Create 2 array define less from left and less from right.
2. Run over the array and determine the maxArea using height[i]*(lessFromleft[i]-lessFromRight[i]-1)
