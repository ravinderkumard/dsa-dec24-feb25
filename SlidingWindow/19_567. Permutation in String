567. Permutation in String

Given two strings s1 and s2, return true if s2 contains a permutation of s1, or false otherwise.

In other words, return true if one of s1's permutations is the substring of s2.

 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 104
	s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

Approach:
Try to process between bucket of s1, its a fixed size sliding window.
if size of s1 is greater than s2 return false as that is not possible to have permutation of s1 in s2.
now try to add 1 element form right and remove elemetn from left and test char array if that is equal, return true 
otherwise return false if no match found.
