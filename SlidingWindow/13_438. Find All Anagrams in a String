438. Find All Anagrams in a String

Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. 
You may return the answer in any order.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".

 
Constraints:

	1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104
	s and p consist of lowercase English letters.


Approach 1:
Start iterating through element from 0 to n-1.
increase the count by 1 for element.
as we reach the size greater of p, start shrinking the element.
Store int index in arraylist.
