Maximum Average Subarray I 

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return all contiguous subarrays of 
minimum possible length such that the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to target.



Approach:
This is Similar to Leet code 643.
Here we have to perform 2 pass.
1. Determine the min length (use same as 643)
2. Using min Length and sliding window technique find all such subarray.
